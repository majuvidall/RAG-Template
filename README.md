# RAG-Template
This repository offers a practical, customizable LangChain RAG pipeline template: PDF loading, chunking, embedding generation, and LLM integration (e.g., OpenAI). It includes a sample RAG article in the `meus_arquivos` folder. All parameters and prompts are preconfigured and easily adaptable.
